  <p><b>Code Breaker 5.10</b> is derived from a game called
    <i>Bulls and Cows</i> of unknown origin. It's game principle is
    public domain. There are commercial versions of <i>Bulls and Cows</i> from
    other parties using different names or trademarks being published,
    distributed, and available as well. <i>Code Breaker 5.10</i> is MIT licensed
    and just uses the public domain principle of the game <i>Bulls and Cows</i>.
    It might come bundled with software using free software licensing. While other
    commercial versions might cover technical solutions and principles that are
    protected by patents or stricter law in general. Be aware if you reuse any
    parts of this project not to infringe such protected intellectual property.
    The by far most successful commercial version is most likely the classic
    board game invented by <i>Mordecai Meirowitz</i> in 1970. Anyway all these
    variants resemble <i>Bulls and Cows</i>, too, with slightly adapted rules,
    other data representation, or modified more or less sophisticated gaming
    material.</p>
  <br clear="all" />
  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <p>The rules of <i>Code Breaker 5.10</i> are as follows.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Iteratively a guess is stated to be compared towards a
      secret five digit code with ten possible values per digit (letters
      from <b>a</b> to <b>j</b>).</li>
    <li>Objective is to match the secret code perfectly indicated
      by a result stating<br /><b>&gt; 5,0</b>.</li>
    <li>On each guess a result indicates the amount of perfect
      matches and imperfect matches represented as numerical values.
      <ul>
        <li>Perfect matches indicate that a digit is included in
          the secret and is placed at correct position
          inside the guess.</li>
        <li>Imperfect matches indicate that a digit is included
          in the secret but the position is still incorrect.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    <li>Thus the secret code is found if five perfect matches
      and no imperfect match are indicated on a check.</li>
    <li>Digit values may occur multiple times. No digit of the
      guess will count multiple times in the indicated result.
      Indicating perfect matches over imperfect ones is
      prioritized. Previous check results are kept visible
      in a log to use for analysis.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is the plain vanilla HMI version of <i>Code Breaker 5.10</i> only.</p>
  <p><b>Please mind that...</b> <i>entering a guess is done on the native keyboard of your device.
    User experience for typing the guess depends on the input
    method and personal settings of your device, e.g. auto
    correction settings.</i></p>
